	Bse: doing read without holding the search lock

Holding the bse search lock when doing read could degrade performance
drmatically since the bse search lock is for all I/O and release thread.
This design is trying to solve this issue by introducing the atomic user_counter
for each ddn

Items:
	Search lock: search_lck is per bse
	atomic user counter: user_counter is per ddn

read:
	get read search_lck
	doing search to find out the rtree node which contains the ddn
	increase user_counter of the ddn
	unlock search_lck
	doing read
	decrease user_counter of the ddn
	if (user_counter == 0)
		free the ddn 
 
bse_del_node:
	waiting until the ddn user_counter decrease to 1
	get the write search_lck
	remove the ddn from the search link list (d_slist)
	remove the ddn node from rtree
	unlock search_lck
	ddn_put_node

ddn_get_node
	set the user_counter = 1

ddn_put_node
	decrease the user_counter
	if (the user_counter == 0)
		free the ddn
